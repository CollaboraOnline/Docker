Scripts and Dockerfiles to build Collabora Online Docker image

To build the container first you need to build the base image and flatten it (to get rid of the history):

```
cd baseimage/
docker build --build-arg SECRET_KEY=<your secret URL part from https://support.libreoffice.collabora.co.uk> -t collabora/online-base .
docker run -d collabora/online-base
#Â Adjust the container id <hash>
docker export <hash> -o /tmp/collabora-flat
docker import /tmp/collabora-flat collabora/online-flattened
```

Afterwards you can build the regular container:
```
cd online/
docker build -t collabora/online .
docker history collabora/online
```

Do not share the secret key with anyone.
