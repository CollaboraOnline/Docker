Scripts and Dockerfiles to build Collabora Online Docker image

To build the container first you need to build the base image and flatten it (to get rid of the history):

```
cd baseimage/
docker build --build-arg SECRET_KEY=<your secret URL part from https://support.collaboraoffice.com, e.g. Example-413539ece39485afc35b4a469adfde0a279d2fd2> -t collabora/online-base .
docker run -d collabora/online-base
#Â Adjust the container id <hash>
docker export -o /tmp/collabora-flat <hash>
docker import /tmp/collabora-flat collabora/online-flattened
```

Afterwards you can build the regular container:
```
cd online/
docker build -t collabora/online .
docker history collabora/online
```

Do not share the secret key with anyone.

start-libreoffice.sh script watches /etc/loolwsd/loolwsd.xml via inotify and forces a restart of the container, in case something changes.

## License key enabled docker image

In directory "key" there is the Dockerfile to build Collabora Online image with support-key, see e.g.:

    quay.io/egroupware/collabora-key

The container is - apart from the repo url - identical to the baseimage container.
